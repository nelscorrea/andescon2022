Text classification models for consumer financial complaints from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). 
Jupyter notebook for talk presented at 2022 IEEE ANDESCON Conference, November 16-19, 2022.

### Models implemented

* [andescon2022_cfpb_classify_baselines.ipynb](andescon2022_cfpb_classify_baselines.ipynb): Bag-of-words (BOW) trigram multinomial naive Bayes (MNB), BOW multi-layer perceptron (MLP), and long short-term memory (LSTM).

* [andescon2022_cfpb_classify_transformer.ipynb](andescon2022_cfpb_classify_transformer.ipynb): DistilBERT and ProsusAI/FinBERT with HuggingFace transformers. 

Libraries used: HuggingFace Transformers, TensorFlow/Keras, Scikit-Learn
